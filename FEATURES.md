# Digital Ocean Server Deployment Tool - Complete Package

I've created a complete automation package that can set up a full-featured web server environment on a Digital Ocean Ubuntu droplet with just a few commands. Here's what this package can do:

## Key Features

1. **One-click server setup** with:
   - LEMP/LAMP stack (Linux, Nginx/Apache, MySQL, PHP)
   - Redis cache server
   - RabbitMQ message broker
   - Automatic security hardening

2. **Simple project deployment**:
   - Upload your code with a single command
   - Automatic dependency installation (Composer/NPM)
   - Environment file configuration
   - Zero downtime deployment with release versioning

3. **Easy Nginx configuration management**:
   - Create/enable/disable virtual hosts
   - Automatic SSL certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
   - Simple domain management

## How to Use the Package

1. **Set up the package**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-ocean-server-deploy.git
   cd digital-ocean-server-deploy
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Configure your server**:
   ```bash
   ./server-deploy.sh
   ```
   This will interactively collect your SSH credentials and server preferences.

3. **Deploy your application**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy /path/to/your/project
   ```

4. **Manage your Nginx configurations**:
   ```bash
   ./nginx-config create yourdomain.com
   ./nginx-config ssl yourdomain.com
   ```

## Package Structure

The package consists of:
- Shell scripts for user interaction and main operations
- Ansible playbooks for server automation
- Configuration templates for all services
- Role-based organization for modular functionality

This solution is highly flexible. Thank You.
